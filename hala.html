<h1>NORWAY</h1>


<p class="justsome">
    Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi)[10]
    and had a population of 5,385,300 in November 2020.[18] The country shares a
    long eastern border with Sweden (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long). Norway is
    bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east and the Skagerrak strait to
     the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has an extensive
     coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea.
     The maritime influence also dominates Norway's climate with mild lowland
     temperatures on the sea coasts, whereas the interior, while colder, is also a
     lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. <br>
     Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace
     on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some
     areas of the country.
